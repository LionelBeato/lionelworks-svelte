I suspect each person believes their loneliness is a special kind of loneliness... The kind of mushy dejectedness that leaves your emotions out of focus, indistinct. I suspect this because I know this to be true for myself. My emotions are valid and true to be sure, but they need not be unique. Or at least, that's the idea.
