Hi, hello, and welcome to my blog! I'm going to be using this place as a dumping ground for my innermost thoughts. Everything regarding this blog is still very much in flux. I've recently rebuilt my website with [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and the experience has been suprisingly smooth. Still, the framework is actively under development, so things might change here as I continue working on this site.

There aren't any further updates from me at the moment. To whoever's reading this: I hope you have a wonderful day! ðŸ˜€
